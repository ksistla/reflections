What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

After running 'git init' command, a new directory called .git is created 
under the 'reflections' directory. Under .git, the following sub directories
are also created: hooks, info, objects and refs. New files: config, 
description and HEAD are also created.

We need to run the 'git init' command in order to convert the directory in 
which the 'git init' is run into a Git repository.
