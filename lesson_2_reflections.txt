What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

After running 'git init' command, a new directory called .git is created 
under the 'reflections' directory. Under .git, the following sub directories
are also created: hooks, info, objects and refs. New files: config, 
description and HEAD are also created.

We need to run the 'git init' command in order to convert the directory in 
which the 'git init' is run into a Git repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The git repository is a storage of all committed files. The working directory is
where files checked out from the repository would be stored. The user would
work on the files, edit them in the working directory. He would move only the 
files that are ready for committing to the staging area. 

The staging area offers a place where the user can move the select set of files
i.e. only those that he wishes to commit to the repository.
