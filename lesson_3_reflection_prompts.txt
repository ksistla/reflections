When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Here are a few reasons to use a remote repository:
1.) when I am working on a project with many other people. The remote repository would be the common place where everyone collborates.
2.) I would use the remote to backup my local work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is better to pull changes manually from GitHub to my local repository because:
1.) I would prefer knowing what changes are being pulled in, what time they will be pulled
2.) This would allow me to schedule the pull at a time convinient to me. I mean, if I was working on a file locally, I would not want an automatic pull overwriting the same file.
3.) Since the remote repository usually houses changes from multiple collaborators, I would also like to be able to decide if I wish to pull the changes of everyone involved.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
1.) Forks: Forking a repository allows the repository to be copied to the user's github. This enables the user to work on the copy without disturbing the original repository. 
2.) Clones: The 'git clone' command is run from the local working directory. It results with the remote's repository being cloned onto the local working directory.
3.) Branches: Every repository begins with a 'master' branch as the only branch. But, when users wish to work on a special feature or a bug fix without disturbing this 'master', a git branch is created. The user can work on the branch (while other users continue to work on the master), and can move his changes from the branch into the master when the work on the branch is completed.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 When I am unable to access the internet, having a copy of the remote's state stored locally on my machine would allow me to continue my work on the local copy. I would then push/merge my changes from my local repository to the GitHub when the internet is availabe and I am done with my changes.

 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 We could you google docs and share them among the collaborators. However I suspect that there could be the following issues with ggogle docs:
 1.) Google docs might not be able to prevent conflicts if collaborators write into a file at the same time.
 2.) Google docs works well of text files but is not well suited for code.

 When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 I would use branches when:
 1.) working on a new feature which would take time and I would not wish to disturb the others working on the master.
 2.) working by myself instead of a large number of collaborators.
